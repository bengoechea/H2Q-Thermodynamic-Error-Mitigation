# h2qec

H²Q (Hysteretic Quantum Error Correction) implements thermodynamic error mitigation for quantum computing, treating syndrome measurement errors as thermal fluctuations that can be filtered using hysteresis-based controls with dwell-time thresholds (φ = 2.67).

This approach achieves 79.7% false positive reduction in Surface Codes and Repetition Codes.
