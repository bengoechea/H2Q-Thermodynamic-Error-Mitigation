# h2qec

H²Q (Hysteretic Quantum Error Correction) implements thermodynamic error mitigation for quantum computing, treating syndrome measurement errors as thermal fluctuations that can be filtered using **domain-calibrated hysteresis-based controls** with **dwell-time persistence**.

This approach achieves 79.7% false positive reduction in Surface Codes and Repetition Codes.
