## About Kenneth A. Mendoza

Kenneth A. Mendoza is an independent quantum computing researcher and inventor based in Los Angeles. With over 35 years of experience spanning molecular biology, hardware validation, and quantum computing, Kenneth brings a unique interdisciplinary perspective to one of technology's most challenging frontiers.

## The Journey to Quantum Computing

Kenneth's path to quantum computing has been anything but conventional. It began in the molecular biology labs at UCLA, where he developed a foundation in scientific methodology and experimental validation. This evolved into a successful two-decade career co-founding Digital Lava, a hardware validation consultancy serving major technology corporations.

A return to UCLA's Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry allowed Kenneth to contribute to cutting-edge proteomics research, working with mass spectrometry and protein analysis. Each of these experiences - from biological research to hardware testing to proteomics - contributed unique insights that would later inform his approach to quantum computing.

## The H²Q Breakthrough

In recent years, Kenneth turned his attention to one of quantum computing's fundamental challenges: how do we trust the results from quantum computers when they're prone to errors? His answer is the Hybrid Harmonic Quantum (H²Q) approach, a novel error mitigation methodology that uses thermodynamic principles to filter out unrealistic quantum solutions.

The innovation is elegant: just as thermodynamics provides natural constraints on physical systems, H²Q applies similar constraints to quantum computations. This helps distinguish genuine quantum advantages from computational artifacts. In benchmarking tests, the approach has demonstrated a 79.7% reduction in false positives for quantum optimization problems.

More precisely (technical but plain-language): on IBM Quantum hardware, H²Q’s hysteresis-stabilized syndrome filtering reduced false-positive error detections by **79.7%** in a representative run (**867 → 176** false-positive detections, i.e., **~20% of baseline**; FP rate **2.23% → 0.45%**).

## Patent-Protected Innovation

Kenneth has filed two provisional patents protecting the H²Q methodology:
- **US Provisional Patent 63/927,371** (November 2025)
- **US Provisional Patent 63/933,465** (December 2025)

These patents cover the thermodynamic approach to quantum error mitigation and represent potentially valuable intellectual property in the emerging quantum computing market.

## Why This Matters

Quantum computing promises to revolutionize fields from drug discovery to financial optimization to materials science. But the technology is still in its early stages, and distinguishing genuine quantum advantages from classical computation remains a critical challenge. Kenneth's work addresses this fundamental problem, potentially accelerating the timeline to practical quantum applications.

## An Interdisciplinary Advantage

What makes Kenneth's approach unique is his interdisciplinary background. While many quantum computing researchers come from physics or computer science, Kenneth draws insights from:
- **Biology:** Understanding complex systems and experimental validation
- **Hardware Testing:** Rigorous validation methodologies and quality assurance
- **Proteomics:** Analytical techniques and data interpretation
- **Entrepreneurship:** Practical problem-solving and result-oriented thinking

This diverse perspective enables him to approach quantum computing problems from angles that might not occur to researchers with more traditional backgrounds in the field.

## Current Focus

Kenneth is currently:
- Refining and validating the H²Q error mitigation methodology
- Expanding benchmarking to additional quantum optimization problems
- Engaging with the quantum computing research community
- Documenting methodology and results for transparency and reproducibility
- Exploring collaboration opportunities with research institutions and technology companies

## Open Source & Transparency

True to scientific principles, Kenneth has made his H²Q implementation available as open source on GitHub. This allows other researchers to validate, critique, and build upon his work - essential steps in advancing quantum computing as a field.

## Vision for the Future

Kenneth believes that practical quantum computing will emerge not from a single breakthrough, but from the accumulated contributions of many researchers addressing different aspects of the technology. His goal is to contribute one piece of that puzzle: a reliable way to validate quantum computational results and accelerate the path to genuine quantum advantage.
